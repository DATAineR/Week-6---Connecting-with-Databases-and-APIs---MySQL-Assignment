    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query follows a specific sequence. The general order is as follows:\n",

    "SELECT: This clause is used to specify the columns you want to retrieve from one or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: Specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve the data specified in the SELECT clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: Filters the rows based on a specified condition. Rows that do not meet the condition are excluded from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: Groups the result set based on one or more columns. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: Specifies a condition to filter the grouped rows created by the GROUP BY clause. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on the result of the GROUP BY operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET or FETCH: Limits the number of rows returned by the query. OFFSET or FETCH is used for pagination, allowing you to skip a certain number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
